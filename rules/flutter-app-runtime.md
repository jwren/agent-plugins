# Proactive Flutter Hot Reload Rule

Whenever you edit or modify any `.dart` file in this project, adhere to the runtime management procedures in the `flutter-app-runtime` skill:

1. **Refer to Skill**:
   - Activate and follow the `flutter-app-runtime` skill workflows for Dart Tooling Daemon (`dtd`), hot reloading, hot restarting, and runtime error inspection.

2. **Discover & Connect**:
   - Discover active running application instances using the `dtd` tool (or `list_running_apps` / `vm_service`).

3. **Trigger Hot Reload / Hot Restart**:
   - Execute `hot_reload` immediately after making changes to UI widgets or simple methods.
   - Execute `hot_restart` if fundamental logic, stateful widgets or logic affecting variables that stateful widgets use, state initialization, or `main()` was modified.

4. **Verify Runtime Stability**:
   - Run `get_runtime_errors` via `dart-mcp-server` to confirm that the hot reload/restart did not introduce new exceptions.

5. **Fallback Handling**:
   - If no running app instance is connected via DTD, briefly inform the user, but do not let it stop you from completing the code edits.
